             <h2>Low and Slow</h2>
             <p>posted by BGB, November 15, 2016<br><br>
             This week I am <i>extremely</i> excited about a new cooking technique called <i>sous vide</i> cooking,
             you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the
             target temperature you want the food tobe cooked to. In his book, <i>Cooking for Geeks,</i> Jeef potter describes it as 
             "ultra-low-temperature poaching."<br><br>
             Next month, we will be serving <b><i>Sous Vide</i> Salmon with Dill Hollandaise.</b> 
             To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before November 30.<br><br>
             Location:<br>
             Baker's Corner, seekonk, MA<br><br>
             Hours:<br>
             Tuesday to Saturday, 11am to 11pm
